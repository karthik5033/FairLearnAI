1) 🧩 Browser Extension — “Fairness Guard”
✅ Goal

Stop students from using AI unfairly outside your app (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
or at least detect and block/limit cheating prompts.

This is your “WOW” feature.

🔥 What the extension actually does

The extension acts like a gatekeeper:

✅ It reads the prompt typed by the student
✅ It sends the prompt to your FairLearnAI backend
✅ Your backend classifies it as:

ALLOWED

HINT_ONLY

DISALLOWED

OFF_TOPIC

✅ Then the extension:

Allows it

Rewrites it to a safe version

Blocks it completely

✅ Core features (Extension MVP)
✅ Feature A: Prompt Interceptor

Extension detects text in:

ChatGPT input box

Gemini input box

Copilot chat input (optional)

Any textarea (general mode)

It basically monitors input + blocks “cheating intent” prompts.

✅ Feature B: Block + Rewrite UI

If student types:

“Give me final answers for this paper”

It shows a pop-up like:
✅ Blocked (Exam Mode)
Reason: Direct answers not allowed
Try: “Give me hints only”

OR it auto converts prompt to:

“Give step-by-step hints only, no final answers”

✅ Feature C: “Exam Mode Toggle”

A teacher can enable exam mode in the platform → extension automatically becomes strict.

That looks insane in demo:

Teacher clicks: ✅ “Exam Mode ON”
Student tries ChatGPT → ❌ blocked
