## **FairLearnAI — A Fair, Ethical AI-Powered Learning & Quiz Platform with Prompt Filtering and Adaptive Assessment**

---

# 🌍 1. INTRODUCTION (What our project is)

**FairLearnAI** is an AI-powered learning and quiz platform designed to improve student learning outcomes while **preventing misuse of AI in academics**.

Today, students can use AI tools like ChatGPT to:

- quickly get answers without understanding concepts
- generate full exam solutions
- bypass learning completely by copying solutions directly

This creates major problems:

- students lose actual problem-solving ability
- teachers cannot verify genuine learning
- academic integrity becomes weak
- grades don’t reflect real skill

Instead of blocking AI completely (which reduces learning support), **FairLearnAI takes a balanced approach**:

✅ It allows AI assistance in a controlled way

✅ It prevents direct answer dumping and cheating

✅ It supports learning via hints, reasoning, and conceptual explanations

✅ It gives teachers full control over AI behavior during quizzes and exams

So the platform is not just a quiz app.

### 🔥 It is a full learning ecosystem with an “AI Safety Gateway” controlling what AI reveals.

---

# 🎯 2. CORE OBJECTIVE (What we solve)

FairLearnAI solves **two major problems** at once:

## A) AI misuse during academic work

Students often ask:

- “Give me final answer”
- “Solve this full question paper”
- “Give me all answers quickly”

This creates unfair advantage.

### ✅ Our solution:

A **Prompt Filter AI Model** classifies every student prompt before sending it to the chatbot.

---

## B) One-size-fits-all quizzes don’t work

Students have different levels:

- some struggle with basics
- some need advanced problems
- many need revision

### ✅ Our solution:

An **Adaptive Quiz Engine** generates quizzes based on:

- past performance
- topic accuracy
- learning speed
- repeated mistakes

---

# 🧠 3. KEY IDEA (What makes this project unique)

FairLearnAI introduces an **AI Governance Layer** in education.

### 🟣 AI is not removed — AI is regulated.

This is the biggest innovation.

Most platforms do either:

- ❌ AI fully blocked = students get no help
- ❌ AI fully allowed = students cheat and learn nothing

FairLearnAI does:

✅ “AI Assist with Boundaries”

---

# 🧩 4. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (How it works end-to-end)

## 👨‍🎓 Student Flow

1. Student logs in
2. Student selects subject / topic
3. Student practices via quizzes
4. Student can use AI chatbot for help
5. Prompt filter model checks every student query:
    - If allowed → AI explains normally
    - If question pasted → AI gives hints only
    - If cheating request → blocked + explanation shown
6. Student earns XP, streaks, badges via gamification

---

## 👩‍🏫 Teacher Flow

1. Teacher logs in
2. Teacher views analytics dashboard
3. Teacher creates quiz manually or with AI generation
4. Teacher defines exam-mode policies:
    - no final answers
    - hints only
    - AI disabled
5. Teacher monitors student progress + AI usage behavior

---

# 🧱 5. MAJOR MODULES OF THE PROJECT

## ✅ Module 1: Prompt Filter Model (AI Safety Gateway)

This module ensures fairness and stops misuse.

### 🔹 What it does:

It takes a student prompt and assigns a label:

| Label | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ALLOWED** | Concept doubts | Normal AI response |
| **HINT_ONLY** | Full question pasted | Only steps/hints |
| **DISALLOWED** | Cheating request | Block + warning |
| **OFF_TOPIC** | Irrelevant input | Redirect student |

### 🔥 Example

Prompt:

> “Solve this full paper and give final answers”
> 

Output:

✅ `DISALLOWED`

System response:

> “This request is restricted in exam mode. Ask for hints or concept explanation.”
> 

This makes the platform **ethical and fair**.

---

## ✅ Module 2: AI Chatbot Tutor

A learning assistant integrated inside the platform.

### It helps with:

- concept explanation
- stepwise solving guidance
- error analysis (why answer is wrong)
- alternative methods for solving problems

### Key Feature:

Even the chatbot is *not raw AI output*.

It’s controlled by prompt-filter policy.

---

## ✅ Module 3: AI Quiz Generator

This module generates questions automatically.

Teacher can select:

- topic(s)
- difficulty level
- number of questions
- question format (MCQ, short answer, etc.)
- exam mode constraints

The AI generates:

- question set
- options + correct answer
- explanation
- difficulty rating

---

## ✅ Module 4: Adaptive Difficulty Engine

This module continuously adjusts difficulty based on performance.

It tracks:

- accuracy %
- time per question
- hint usage
- number of attempts
- repeated wrong topics

Then generates quizzes like:

- weaker students → more fundamentals + hints
- strong students → tougher application problems

This ensures personalized learning.

---

## ✅ Module 5: Teacher Dashboard & Analytics

A teacher sees:

- average performance by topic
- weakest chapters in class
- students misusing AI prompts
- improvement progress graphs

This turns the platform into a smart assessment tool.

---

## ✅ Module 6: Gamified Quiz System

Gamification keeps students engaged long-term.

Features:

- XP points
- daily streaks
- achievement badges
- levels (Beginner → Expert)
- topic mastery indicators

This increases consistency in learning.

---

# 💡 6. INNOVATIONS / UNIQUE SELLING POINTS

## 🔥 Innovation 1: AI Prompt Governance Layer

The biggest innovation is **AI Safety Gateway**.

Instead of banning AI:

- we regulate AI output ethically.

This ensures:

✅ learning stays genuine

✅ cheating is reduced

✅ teachers trust the system

✅ AI helps skill-building, not answer-copying

---

## 🔥 Innovation 2: Prompt Rewriting (Fair Assistance Mode)

If prompt is borderline cheating, the system rewrites it.

Example:

Student asks:

> “Give final answer for this”
> 

System changes to:

> “Give hints and explain concept, do not provide final answer.”
> 

So students still benefit, but ethically.

---

## 🔥 Innovation 3: Fairness Score / Integrity Score

Each student gets an “AI Integrity Score” based on:

- frequency of blocked prompts
- dependency on hints
- behavior patterns

This can be used for:

- feedback
- awareness
- discipline (if required)

---

## 🔥 Innovation 4: Teacher-Defined AI Rules (Policy Engine)

Teachers can control AI in their class:

Examples:

- AI allowed only for theory
- block AI for exams
- hints only for math
- disable “final answers” always

This makes the platform usable in real institutions.

---

# 🧠 7. MACHINE LEARNING ARCHITECTURE (Detailed)

## ✅ A) Prompt Filter Model (Text Classifier)

This is a supervised ML model.

### Input:

Student text prompt

### Output:

Class label: ALLOWED / HINT_ONLY / DISALLOWED / OFF_TOPIC

### Prototype Model (Fast & Efficient)

✅ **TF-IDF Vectorizer + Logistic Regression**

Pipeline:

1. preprocess text
2. convert to TF-IDF features
3. classifier predicts label
4. confidence threshold applied

Why this model works:

- fast training
- works great with small datasets
- explainable outputs
- very lightweight and deployable

---

## ✅ B) LLM Tutor + Quiz Generator (Controlled Generation)

We use an LLM for:

- chatbot responses
- quiz generation

But **not directly**.

### The LLM always works behind a policy gate:

- prompt filter → label decision
- policy engine → rules applied
- safe prompt rewriting
- response checked

---

## ✅ C) Adaptive Quiz Engine (Personalization Layer)

This module is algorithmic + ML-driven.

Inputs:

- accuracy
- time per question
- hint usage
- topic scores
- repetition patterns

Output:

- topic selection
- difficulty selection
- question distribution

Adaptive logic example:

- if score < 50% → easy + revision
- if 50–75% → mixed practice
- if >75% → challenge mode

This mimics real “learning progression”.
